# XYLO VC Process

## DAO-based, Community-led Crypto VC

As XYLO is a DPoI (Delegated Proof of Investment)-based blockchain platform, the community can function as a “VC” through the investment of token holders. The basic concept of XYLO's DPOI is to maximize profits by facilitating investors to invest in various new projects by rationally executing the funds invested in the 'Community Pool' through DAO. In addition, this concept aims to continuously develop the ecosystem by encouraging reinvestment in the fund.

## Investment Pre-screening in Forum

Project teams wishing to receive investment may publish a proposal by tagging the Governance & Proposal category to support pre-screening in the forum in accordance with the guidelines below. Discussion on pre-screening must be held for at least 7 days in the forum. After discussing the opinions of various investors, the main voting process will be processed. During this discussion, the investor may request the project team for additional materials as needed, and the project team must provide the requested materials.
